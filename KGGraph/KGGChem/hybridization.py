        Calculate the number of lone pairs on a given atom. This method estimates the number of lone pairs by subtracting the total number

        that each atom has a fixed bonding capacity based on its hybridization state (sp, sp2, sp3, etc.), and any valence electrons not involved 
        in single bonding can be considered as part of lone pairs.

        Parameters:
        atom (Chem.Atom): The atom for which the number of lone pairs is to be computed. This atom should be part of a molecule object.
