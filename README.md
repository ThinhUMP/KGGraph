## Installation

1. **Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages. Use the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv kggraph-env
source kggraph-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `synrbl-env\Scripts\activate`
```
Or Conda

```bash
conda create --name kggraph-env python=3.11
conda activate kggraph-env
  ```
2. **Cloning and Installing KGGraph:**

Clone the KGGraph repository and install it using the `setup.py` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KGGraph.git
cd KGGraph
python setup.py install
```
