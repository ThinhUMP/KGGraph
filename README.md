# KGG
Knowledge-Guided Graph Self-Supervised Learning for Molecular Property Predictions [(ChemRxiv)](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/68088e84e561f77ed461ef2d)

## Overview

**Knowledge‚ÄëGuided Graph (KGG)** is a lightweight, self‚Äësupervised pre‚Äëtraining framework that injects orbital‚Äëlevel chemical knowledge into Graph‚ÄØNeural‚ÄØNetworks (GNNs) for molecular property prediction.

### Why KGG?
- **Orbital‚Äëaware descriptors** ‚Äì Hybridization‚Äë and bond‚Äëtype vectors embed explicit orbital information for richer chemical context. 
- **Data‚Äëefficient pre‚Äëtraining** ‚Äì Self‚Äësupervised on ~250‚ÄØk ZINC15 molecules (‚âà10‚ÄØ√ó less than typical), easing label scarcity and lowering contamination ratio.  
- **Plug‚Äëand‚Äëplay compatibility** ‚Äì Works out of the box with popular GNN backbones (GIN, GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE).  
- **State‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart accuracy** ‚Äì Consistently surpasses existing methods across diverse molecular property benchmarks, especially with noisy data.  
- **Chemically interpretable embeddings** ‚Äì t‚ÄëSNE and fingerprint analyses show clear, domain‚Äëaligned clustering.

## Installation

To install and set up the KGG framework, follow these steps. 

### **Step by step installation**

**Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
  It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages. Use the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a new Conda environment with Python 3.11
conda create -n kgg python=3.11
conda activate kgg

# Install torch and rdkit packages
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
conda install -c conda-forge rdkit

# Install PyTorch Geometric and dependencies
pip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.0+cu118.html
pip install torch_geometric

# Install utility libraries
pip3 install -U scikit-learn
pip install joblib pytest black
```

### **Install from environment.yml:**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Reproduce

### üìÇ Dataset

- **Pre-training data**: `Data/pretrain_datasets/`
- **Fine-tuning datasets**:  
  - Classification tasks: `Data/classification/`  
  - Regression tasks: `Data/regression/`

---

### üì¶ Pretrained Models

- Download [pretrained ZINC15 models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jI_20IKUhSn4_YKu9B7EobLFd7KNxS3T?usp=sharing) and [pretrained ChEMBL29 models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j3igj7nNr4OYmBCOB9lXJeYuYSEdivCl?usp=sharing)
- After downloading, place the pretrained model files in the following directory: `./pretrained_model_zinc15/` or `./pretrained_model_chembl29/`


### Pre-training
To begin pre-training, modify the arguments in `pretrain.py` as needed for your experiment, then run:
```bash
python pretrain.py
```
### Fine-tuning
To begin fine-tuning, modify the arguments in `finetune.py` as needed for your experiment, then run:
```bash
python finetune.py
```
### Analysis
To begin analyzing, modify the arguments in `fgs.py` or `knn.py` or `tsne.py` as needed for your experiment, then run:
- Comparison with fingerprints
```bash
python Docs/scripts/fgs.py
```
- knn model
```bash
python Docs/scripts/knn.py
```
- tsne visualization
```bash
python Docs/scripts/tsne.py
```
